        Albert Einstein (/ˈaɪnstaɪn/ EYEN-styne;[6] German: [ˈalbɛʁt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn]
        (listen); 14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical
        physicist,[7] widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest and most
        influential physicists of all time. Einstein is best known for
        developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important
        contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics.
        Relativity and quantum mechanics are the two pillars of modern
        physics.[3][8] His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises
        from relativity theory, has been dubbed "the world's most famous
        equation".[9] His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy
        of science.[10][11] He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his
        services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the
        law of the photoelectric effect",[12] a pivotal step in the development
        of quantum theory. His intellectual achievements and originality
        resulted in "Einstein" becoming synonymous with "genius".[13]
        Einsteinium, one of the synthetic elements in the periodic table, was
        named in his honor.[14]
